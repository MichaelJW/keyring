This backend is the default on Windows. It uses the native Windows
Credential API, and needs at least Windows XP to run.

This backend supports multiple keyrings. Note that multiple keyrings
are implemented in the \code{keyring} R package, using some dummy keyring
keys that represent keyrings and their locked/unlocked state.
